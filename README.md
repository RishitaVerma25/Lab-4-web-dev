
## Web Dev I - Lab 4: The Prompt Quizzer (Enhanced)

Hello! This is the JavaScript code for the Prompt Quizzer, built for Web Dev I Lab 4.

It is a simple quiz game designed to run entirely within the browser's Console, which reinforces our use of arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals.

# What the Code Does

-   *Core Logic:* The logic is structured using the required functions, loops (for and while), and conditional statements.
-   *Questions:* The quiz contains 10 questions, which exceeds the minimum requirement of the assignment.
-   *Robust Checking:* User input is processed to ignore capitalization and extra spaces (toLowerCase() and .trim()), ensuring fair scoring.
-   *Flexible Answers:* Questions with multiple correct forms (like "HTML" and "HyperText Markup Language") accept both.
-   *Final Score:* The score is tracked and displayed out of 10 when the quiz finishes.
-   *Replay Option:* A while loop is used to prompt the user if they want to play the quiz again.

# How to Run It

It is easy to run this code in any browser:

1.  Open Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or any web browser.
2.  Press *F12* on your keyboard to open the Developer Tools.
3.  Click on the *Console* tab.
